*~~Never stop programming with C#, keep beat Java!(it's a joke bro but Java are useless for me)~~*</br>
*This statement has been changed after November of 2021 year, because I started to learning Java and Kotlin.*

(Yes I still stuck in loves with C# but I have some ability with other programming languages: JavaScript, HTML5, CSS, C++ and Batch/Bash Script)

### My active projects:
[![Material.Avalonia](https://img.shields.io/badge/Material.Avalonia-ff69b4)](https://github.com/AvaloniaUtils/material.avalonia)
> AvaloniaUI performances are better than WPF, you should try this with AvaloniaUI to create Desktop Application with basic Material Design, if you care about performances and more better UI library without any CEF ([Chromium Embedded Framework](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromium_Embedded_Framework)) to run everywhere!

[![tak2flac-tools](https://img.shields.io/badge/tak2flac-tools-brightgreen)](https://github.com/appleneko2001/tak2flac)
> Very handy when you don't want to write a lot commands / do a lot useless work for just split a tak file in Linux or Windows. FFMpeg required.

[![Github-ProfileLeftDockFix](https://img.shields.io/badge/Github-ProfileLeftDockFix-brightgreen)](https://github.com/appleneko2001/GithubProfileLeftDockFix)
> Fix the damn left details layout of Github profile.
