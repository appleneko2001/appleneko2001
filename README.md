I'm a ~~osu noob~~ (lol) just kidding. I dont want to wrote some introduction cuz I only have ~~me and my trash repos~~.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on [Material.Avalonia](https://github.com/AvaloniaUtils/material.avalonia)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning AvaloniaUI
- 📫 How to reach me: appleneko2001@outlook.com (will respond after a long time due disabled notifications, messenger contact will more faster)

*Never stop programming with C#, ~~keep beat Java!~~(it's a joke bro but Java are useless for me)*

(Yes I still stuck in loves with C# but I have some ability with other programming languages: JavaScript, HTML5, CSS, C++ and Batch/Bash Script)

### My active projects:
[![Material.Avalonia](https://img.shields.io/badge/Material.Avalonia-ff69b4)](https://github.com/AvaloniaUtils/material.avalonia)
> I'm working for Material.Avalonia improvements now! AvaloniaUI performances are better than WPF, you should try this with AvaloniaUI to create Desktop Application, if you care about performances and more better UI library without any CEF ([Chromium Embedded Framework](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromium_Embedded_Framework)) to run everywhere!

[![tak2flac-tools](https://img.shields.io/badge/tak2flac-tools-brightgreen)](https://github.com/appleneko2001/tak2flac)
> Very handy when you don't want to write a lot commands / do a lot useless work for just split a tak file in Linux or Windows. FFMpeg required.

[![Github-ProfileLeftDockFix](https://img.shields.io/badge/Github-ProfileLeftDockFix-brightgreen)](https://github.com/appleneko2001/GithubProfileLeftDockFix)
> Fix the damn left details layout of Github profile.

### Graveyards repositories:
[My hexo blog](https://github.com/appleneko2001/appleneko2001.github.io), [WPF Music Player with Material Design](https://github.com/appleneko2001/NekoPlayer-Alpha), 
[LrcParser with TimeSpan patches](https://github.com/appleneko2001/LrcParser), [Material Design in XAML Mod](https://github.com/appleneko2001/MaterialDesignInXaml-Mod)

> But don't worry, they still have chances to revive again when I still alive!
