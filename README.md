I'm a ~~osu noob~~ (lol) just kidding. I dont want to wrote some introduction cuz I only have ~~me and my trash repos~~.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on osulazer translate and slightly improving
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Unreal Engine 4
- 📫 How to reach me: appleneko2001@outlook.com

But if u interested my repos, keep going ;)

### Currently I have ability to programming with (actually it is my primary choise):
<p>
  <p align="right" width="50%">
  C# (CSharp) is a programming language that better than Java and easier than C++. If you still lost in Java or confused or whatever, just come learn some C# and go write some C# code!
    
    
  </p>
  <code><img src="https://github.com/abranhe/programming-languages-logos/blob/master/src/csharp/csharp_512x512.png" width="30%"></code>
</p>

* (Yes I still stuck in loves with C# but I have some ability with other programming languages: JavaScript, HTML5, CSS, C++ and Batch/Bash Script)

*Never stop programming with C#, ~~keep beat Java!~~(it's a joke bro but Java are useless for me)*
